    <h1>CoffeeVS helps you find cards and build decks for Universus</h1>
    <p>Search features</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The Name filter dropdown has the names of all cards that match your other filters</li>
    <li>You can also type a partial string (or regular expression) into the Name Search field</li>
    <li>You will only see cards that match ALL your filters</li>
    <li>Set, Card Type, and Symbol filters allow multiple selections, and show cards that match ANY of those selected</li>
    <li>Two Symbol filters allow you to combine AND / OR matching</li>
    <li>For example, to find cards with Earth AND either Life OR Order, select Earth with one, and Life + Order in the other</li>
    <li>All cards should have names and resource symbols, but other properties (especially text) are more limited</li>
    <p>Deckbuilding</p>
    <li>On the search/home page, click on a card to add a copy to your deck; rightclick to remove</li>
    <li>You cannot add cards to more than 4 copies; if you remove the last copy, the card will leave your deck entirely</li>
    <li>On the Deck page, you can adjust quantities with the buttons in the "Qty" row</li>
    <li>You can save your deck offline with the "Download as .txt" button. Cloud storage coming... eventually</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Formats:</p>
    <ul><li>Standard includes recent promos, DLC, and sets dating back to Battle for Power</li>
        <li>Retro dates to Red Horizon, and includes a variety of old promos, and also includes all of Standard</li>
        <li>Future solely includes unreleased promos (Princess and the Pea)</li>
        <li>Playtest solely includes cards released for Community Playtest on Tabletop Simulator. Updated 28 Nov 2020</li>
